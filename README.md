# Cred Up 📈

**Cred Up** is a mobile app designed to help students and young individuals **build and improve their credit scores** using **alternative data** like rent payments, utility bills, and other non-traditional financial activities.

---

## 💡 Idea

Most students and freelancers struggle with building credit because they don’t have access to traditional credit-building tools like loans or credit cards. **Cred Up** changes that by:

- Using **alternative data** (rent, electricity, internet bills, subscriptions) to reflect financial responsibility.
- Providing a simple and beautiful UI to register and manage your profile.
- Helping users understand how their day-to-day activities affect their creditworthiness.
- Potentially integrating with credit bureaus (in future versions) to actually report these data points.

## 🎯 Features (Planned)

- 🔐 Secure account creation and login
- 📊 Dashboard to view credit progress
- 🧾 Upload and verify bills/rent receipts
- 🔎 AI-powered risk assessment and score simulation
- 📬 Reminders for due payments
- 🎓 Tips to improve credit score

## 🌙 Dark Mode UI

The registration screen is designed with a modern **dark theme**, inspired by popular finance apps — intuitive and sleek for a smooth user experience.

---

## 🚧 Status

This is an early-stage design and development project.  
The current focus is on building the UI with Flutter, followed by integrating backend logic and credit assessment algorithms.
